## About this project

Code needs some cleanup and improvements. It was created to implement a basic fuzzer.
By the way, this module deals only with a subset of regular expressions.

Feel free to contribute.

It's mainly based on the Perl module String::Random by Steven Pritchard <steve@silug.org> (now maintained by Shlomi Fish).

You can read more about this Perl module here -> http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/String-Random-0.28/lib/String/Random.pm
