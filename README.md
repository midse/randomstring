# randomstring

This module generates a random string from a pattern. The code is based on the Perl module String::Random by Steven Pritchard <steve@silug.org> (now maintained by Shlomi Fish). You can read more about this Perl module here http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/String-Random-0.28/lib/String/Random.pm
